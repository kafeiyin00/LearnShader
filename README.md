some stupid test on shader and GPU

### test2: test on laser frames showing

### test7: test on cuda projection
I implement the projection of laser scanning points on image based on 
GPU and CPU, and compare the running time. The CPU WIN T.T

GPU cost 298ms, CPU cost 141ms.

### test8: test on cuda normal estimation
I implement the normal estimation of the projected laser scanning points

GPU cost 230ms
